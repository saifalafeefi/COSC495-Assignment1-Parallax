# Chromatic Cleanse

A 2D action platformer where color is the enemy.

## Concept

You are the last monochrome being in a world overrun by vibrant chaos. Armed with precision combat skills and advanced movement abilities, your mission is to eliminate all traces of color and restore balance.

## Gameplay

**Combat:**

- 3-hit combo system with finisher attacks
- Aerial combat for vertical control
- Dodge roll with invincibility frames
- Each attack has unique range and damage

**Movement:**

- Double jump for extended air control
- Wall jump to climb any surface
- Roll dodge to phase through enemies
- Variable jump height (tap vs hold)

**Powerups:**
Colored vials grant temporary abilities based on their hue:

- **Green Vial:** Restores health (healing surge)
- **Yellow Vial:** Speed boost (movement + attack speed, pierce enemy defenses)

Colors betray their purpose, use them wisely, then eliminate the source.

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys:** Move
- **Space:** Jump (hold for higher jumps)
- **A:** Attack
- **Left Shift:** Roll

## Features

- HP system with visual feedback
