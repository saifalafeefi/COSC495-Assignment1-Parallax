# Chromatic Cleanse

A 2D action platformer where color is the enemy.

## Concept

You are the last monochrome being in a world overrun by vibrant chaos. Armed with precision combat skills and advanced movement abilities, your mission is to eliminate all traces of color and restore balance.

## Gameplay

**Combat:**

- 3-hit combo system with finisher attacks
- Aerial combat for vertical control
- Dodge roll with invincibility frames
- Each attack has unique range and damage

**Movement:**

- Double jump for extended air control
- Wall jump to climb any surface
- Roll dodge to phase through enemies
- Variable jump height (tap vs hold)

**Powerups:**
Colored vials grant temporary abilities based on their hue:

- **Green Vial:** Restores 1 health point
- **Yellow Vial:** Speed boost
- **Red Vial:** Damage boost
- **Purple Vial:** Slow time (oh yeah!)

Colors betray their purpose, use them wisely, then eliminate the source.

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys:** Move
- **Space:** Jump (hold for higher jumps)
- **A:** Attack
- **S:** Special ranged attack
- **Left Shift:** Roll

## Features

- HP system with visual feedback
- Invincibility frames with flash effect
- Enemy knockback and damage system
- Smooth camera follow
- Combo attack chains
- Advanced movement mechanics (wall jump, double jump, roll, air attack bounce)
